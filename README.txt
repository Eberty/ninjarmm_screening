## **Overview**

Thank you for considering me for the open position at NinjaOne. I thoroughly enjoyed completing the coding challenge, and I hope that my submission meets your expectations. Below is a summary of my submission:

**Author:** Eberty Alves da Silva, <eberty.silva@hotmail.com>

**Keywords:** C++, NinjaOne.

## **Step 1**

For Challenge 1, I developed a C++ program using the object-oriented software development methodology. The program consists of three classes: Job, Programmer, and Pilot. A utils header was included to implement other requirements listed.

Although the Requirements.txt requires the Job class to provide an interface that can perform specific tasks, it's unclear whether the class should be a pure virtual class or not.

Instead of using the Google gtest framework, I wrote my own unit tests using the C++ standard library.

To improve the code's documentation, I used the Doxygen format to document the classes and functions. I also organized the code into separate header and source files, and used CMake to manage the compilation of the project and unit tests.

## **Step 2**

For Challenge 2, although it was requested that the source code be structured with a subfolder called "src", for the purposes of this challenge I prefer to keep the original file and provide feedback on it.

While the main idea is clear and the code would work with just the inclusion of headers and the main function, I opted to be somewhat critical in my review. I provided a mix of suggested improvements and comments on what could be done to further improve the code and avoid memory leaks.

## **Step 3**

For Challenge 3, I provided a detailed argumentation in the file regarding what I believe to be the best approach to meet the requirements outlined in the CodeChallenge.cpp file.

## **About me**

I'm a software developer with experience in C/C++, Visual Computer and Graphical User Interfaces. Throughout my career, I have contributed to numerous research and development projects, such as developing 3D modeling software for the fashion industry, programming an underwater inspection robot, and updating a software solution for broadcast graphics.

My academic background is in Computer Science, and I have a master's degree in low-cost 3D reconstruction for cultural heritage. Over the years, I have honed my skills in various technologies, such as Qt, Git, CMake, OpenGL, Boost, OpenCV, PCL, Eigen, OpenSceneGraph, ROS, Graphviz, Docker, Linux, and Shell Script.

My specialty lies in developing GUIs using the Qt framework in C++. However, I have also worked with Python, HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript on smaller projects. Additionally, I have expertise in image processing, Structure-from-Motion, and control for robotics.

I possess excellent communication skills and have experience working in international teams.

To see some of my work, please check out my GitHub repositories:

    https://github.com/Eberty/LowCost3DReconstruction (my master's thesis project)
    https://github.com/Eberty/QtOpenGL (a presentation project)

I hope these repositories and this merge request provide a better understanding of my skills and capabilities.
